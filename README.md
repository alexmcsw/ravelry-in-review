# ravelry-in-review
Analysis and visualizations exploring my knitting activity

## Data

Ravelry data can be accessed via API or by exporting data in JSON format in your account. For this project I chose to export my data so I could get right into the analysis rather than fiddling with the API.

## Analysis

Let's explore

- number and type of projects by year
- types of yarn used
- colour used
